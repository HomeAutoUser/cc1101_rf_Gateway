# cc1101_rf_Gateway uC v1.0.17pre with cc110x support 

### Getting started


System to receive digital signals and provide them to other systems for demodulation. A CC1101 is used as receiver. The cabling is analogue and compatible with the SIGNALduino. You can toggle up to 4 reception modes with a minimum time of 30 seconds. It can be operated via the WEB interface or the uC command (telnet). Standard operation is possible via FHEM. <br>Current reception modes are (values can be compiled in or compiled out yourself) :
  - CC110x Factory Default (standard values according to data sheet)
  - Avantek
  - Bresser_5in1
  - Bresser_6in1
  - Bresser_7in1
  - Fine_Offset_WH51_434
  - Fine_Offset_WH51_868
  - Fine_Offset_WH57_434
  - Fine_Offset_WH57_868
  - Inkbird_IBS_P01R
  - KOPP_FC
  - Lacrosse_mode1
  - Lacrosse_mode2
  - OOK - Modulation on 433MHz
  - PCA301
  - Rojaflex
  - X_Sense
  - ... some developmentÂ´s


Just clone the repo and open the project file with Visual Studio (only available for windows) or VSCode.
You can also open it with the Arduino IDE. 
Compile it and have fun.
If you are using the Arduino IDE, you have to copy all the libs into your sketch folder and modify some includes.<br>
required libraries: [digitalWriteFast](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/digitalwritefast/), [WebSockets](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/websockets/)

### Using cc1101_rf_Gateway in FHEM

1. check if you have the current SIGNALduino source in the update list <br> ( source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RFD-FHEM/RFFHEM/master/controls_signalduino.txt )
2. update your FHEM
3. define one SIGNALduino device <br> ( define \<name\> SIGNALduino \<device\> )
4. check the reading 'state' and if communication is successful it says 'opened'

### Tested microcontrollers

* Arduino Nano
* Arduino Pro Mini
* ESP32 (ESP32-WROOM-32 / ESP32-WROOM-32D)
* ESP8266
* RadinoCC1101
