# cc1101_rf_Gateway uC v1.0.10 with cc1101 support 

### Getting started


System to receive digital signals and provide them to other systems for demodulation. Currently tested with 433 MHz, but not limited to that frequency or media.


Just clone the repo and open the project file with Visual Studio (only available for windows) or VSCode.
You can also open it with the Arduino IDE. 
Compile it and have fun.
If you are using the Arduino IDE, you have to copy all the libs into your sketch folder and modify some includes.

### Using cc1101_rf in FHEM

-> will be added


### Tested microcontrollers

* Arduino Nano
* Arduino Pro Mini
* ESP32 (ESP32-WROOM-32 / ESP32-WROOM-32D)
* ESP8266
* RadinoCC1101
